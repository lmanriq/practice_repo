“Be soft. Do not let the world make you hard. Do not let pain make you hate. Do not let the bitterness steal your sweetness. Take pride that even though the rest of the world may disagree, you still believe it to be a beautiful place.”
Kurt Vonnegut

“A book, too, can be a star, a living fire to lighten the darkness, leading out into the expanding universe.”
Madeleine L'Engle
